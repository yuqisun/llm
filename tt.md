很高兴今天有机会和大家更新moogle最新的状态。moogle主要用于搜索视频和文档，经过我们的积累，当前共有超过220小时的视频和540个用户。

首先我们回顾一下搜索视频的功能，上次在GenAI的会议开完之后，来自xx的xx联系了我，这是一个提高搜索效率的途径，typically, it usually takes more than half hour to locate the needed information in a one hour-long video. 使用moogle，最多不会超过10秒，效率提高99.6%。Not to mention currently we have over 220 hours' video data.

另一个主要功能是文件搜索，我给他们分了类，这个功能来自于Ram上次的需求，在固定范围内进行搜索而非全局搜索，这是个临时解决方案，因为想做到对任意一个或多个文件进行搜索需要重新对文件进行向量化并按标签存储，需要更多的时间来完成。

这个场景为来自于香港的用户提供了帮助，他们联系我因为他们有很多关于basel 3的文件，需要从中查找相关内容，费时费力。借助moogle，他们可以迅速定位答案在文件中的位置，节省时间。

当前我们也在申请公司的api key，它需要很多paper work，当前我们完成了xxx，xxx和xxx，昨天刚提交了MRM的PD，还需要AIOC 的non-objection，我正在查文档应该如何处理。

---

诚然，我们当前有很多挑战，主要来自于zoom和colaterate。这也证实了该功能的前景。那我们如何与他们竞争呢。

无论是zoom还是colaterate，当前zoom的ai功能还不能体验，但是他们都是针对单一视频，因为他们专注于当前的会议。zoom是以ai来问答，coolaterate是关键字进行搜索，不支持语义。而我们专注于公司内部的知识分享，是在大量视频文档中寻找答案，包括wiki等网站，是一个包含视频和文档问答定位综合解决方案。

---

而且因为我们的内容是以文件为单位的，每次搜索的答案可能包含在多个文件当中，文件之间有联系，所以我们可以尝试通过现有的文件建立起knowledge graph，让用户更直观的对资料进行查询。

I am delighted to have the opportunity today to update everyone on the latest status of moogle. Moogle is primarily used for searching videos and documents, and thanks to our accumulation, we currently have over 220 hours of video content and 540 users across xxx locations.

First, let's review the video search functionality. After our last meeting at GenAI, I was contacted by [Name] from [Location]. This is a way to improve search efficiency. Typically, it usually takes more than half an hour to locate the needed information in a one-hour-long video. With moogle, it won't take more than 10 seconds, which is a 99.6% increase in efficiency. Not to mention, we currently have over 220 hours of video data.

Another main feature is file search. I have categorized them for this function, which originated from Ram's last requirement. It searches within a fixed range rather than globally. This is a temporary solution because to search for any one or multiple files, we need to re-vectorize the files and store them by tags, which will take more time to complete.

This scenario has been helpful for users from Hong Kong. They contacted me because they have many documents related to Basel III and needed to find relevant content, which was time-consuming. With the help of moogle, they can quickly locate the answer within the documents and save time.

------

Currently, we are also applying for the company's API key, which requires a lot of paperwork. We have completed [Document 1], [Document 2], and [Document 3], and just submitted the PD for MRM yesterday. We still need the non-objection from AIOC, and I am looking into the documentation on how to handle it.

------

Admittedly, we currently face many challenges, mainly from Zoom and Collate. This also confirms the potential of this feature. So, how do we compete with them?

Whether it's Zoom or Collate, Zoom's AI features are not yet available for experience, but they both focus on individual videos because they concentrate on current meetings. Zoom uses AI for Q&A, and Collate searches by keywords, without semantic support. We focus on internal knowledge sharing within companies, searching for answers in a large volume of video documents, including websites like wikis, which is a comprehensive solution that includes video and document Q&A localization.

------

Moreover, because our content is file-based, each search result may be contained in multiple files, and there are connections between the files. Therefore, we can attempt to establish a knowledge graph through existing files, allowing users to query the materials more intuitively.
